- [ ] vault integration

- [ ] for "serve" testing: does using an HTTP proxy offload the DNS? so we could use it to fake it?

- [ ] do combinatoric test for certificate requirements, and document my findings
    - only need to see if chrome says it's malformed, doesn't need to be trusted. So don't worry about trusting the CA.
- [ ] support arbitrary cert chaining
- [ ] name constraints
